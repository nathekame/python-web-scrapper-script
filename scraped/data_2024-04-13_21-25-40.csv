Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post.', 'Closed 2 years ago.', 'How does this concept check out?.', 'A genetically-altered (i.e. raised from birth) human with muscle proteins that have been developed, ""folded"" (i.e. the way muscle fibers interact with one another), structured or otherwise modified to be more effective while retaining the same density. Therefore, they\'re proportionately stronger than a baseline human while not having any increase in muscle mass.']","[""I don't really understand what kind of answers do you want to get asking"", 'How does this concept checks out.', 'Anyway I will try to explain what I think about reliably of such concept. First, consider the efficiency of human muscle is rather low, 18-26%. It is caused by several factors i.a. losses in converting energy from food into ATP, loses in converting energy from ATP into muscle contraction and other mechanical loses. Those factors depends on the type of muscle fibers, their structure and so on.', 'So I can see at least two possible factors that could potentially be improved, perhaps by developed enough genetic technology', ""One is type and structure of muscle fibers. The rather 'easy' thing to improve would be to improve ratio of fast-twitch vs slow-twitch fibers to be optimal for specific kind of muscle responsible for specific type movement. More difficult, but still something that I consider believable or doable with appropriate technology would be to develop different, better, more efficient type of muscle fibers."", 'Second one is usage of alternative energy provider. So imagine developing muscles that uses some more efficient energy provider than ATP. This is something that I consider much more difficult (therefore you as a storyteller would have much more work to convenience reader its reasonable) but still possible to imagine.', ""BTW I don't think @DWKraus is right in this comment, because in general evolution in most cases does not develop optimal solution. Natural selection usually promotes greedy solutions. It is usually rather a local optimum which means that there might be significantly better solutions that simply could not be developed because small improvement of existing ones was a better adaptation to environment."", 'So to summarize. I consider this kind of concept pretty rational and believable in science-fiction world.']"
